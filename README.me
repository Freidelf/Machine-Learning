This is a repository in **which** I add code and text that helps me to understand machine learning concepts.

The main source used is the book "The elements of statistical learning", avaliable at https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/.

I will read each chapter and try to reproduce the graphs shown in the book as well as solve some of the excersices at the end of the chapters.
